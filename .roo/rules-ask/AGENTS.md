# Ask Mode Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- **Roadmap**: Always check [`notes.txt`](notes.txt) for current development status and planned features.
- **Database Schema**: The Google Sheets schema (11 columns) is defined in [`backend/src/sheets.ts:COLUMNS`](backend/src/sheets.ts).
- **Structure**: Backend and Frontend are managed as independent projects within the same repo (separate `package.json`).
